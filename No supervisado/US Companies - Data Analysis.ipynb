    "Se trabajará con un dataset que contiene información de un gran número de empresas de estados unidos con características para cada una de ellas. El objetivo es reducir el número de empresas con las que se trabaja a las relacionadas con el área software. Luego se generará de manera random una columna nueva que diga el puesto de trabajo que la empresa en cuestión está buscando (simulando que las empresas han sido extraídas de un motor de búsqueda determinado). Se provocará que la misma empresa busque por varios puestos de trabajo y a través de algoritmos de clustering se buscará agrupar por empresas suponiendo que el número de empresas es desconocido. Es decir el objetivo es hacer clustering para encontrar todos los post hechos por una misma empresa."
